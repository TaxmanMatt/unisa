Question 7

a) It's the memory address of a variable.

b) Produces the variable that it points to.

c) p1 = p2; assigns the value of one pointer variable to another.
   *p1 = *p2; assigns the value of the pointer itself to another.

d) Is an undefined pointer variable.

e) A variable that once used, it's memory space is returned for use by another.

f) It produces a new variable and returns a pointer that points to this variable.

g) It deletes a dynamic variable and returns the memory that the dynamic variable occupied to the freestore.

h) It's the part of a computers memory that's assigned for use by dynamic variables.

i) Automatic variables are the normal variables we declare in our functions.

j) It's an array whose size is determined when the program is running.

k) They are more efficient with their memory use.

l) An array name is essentially a pointer.

m) int* p1, p2; assigns only p1 as the pointer variable whereas the latter ensures both p1 and p2 are assigned as pointer variables.

n)
i- typedef double* DoublePtr;
   DoublePtr fPtr1, fPtr2;

ii- DoublePtr *p;
    p = new DoublePtr;

iii- *fPtr1 = *fPtr2;

iv- cout << p;

v- cout << *p;

vi- delete p;

vii- p = NULL;

o)

#include <iostream>
#include <cstddef>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Enter size of array: ";
    size_t length{};
    cin >> length;

    int *array{ new int[length]{} };
    cout << "Array of integers of length " << length << " allocated."<< endl;

    // Loop to request integer for each element.
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        cout << "Please enter your integer: ";
        cin >> array[i];
    }

    // TODO Loop through array for largest integer.
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        //check for largest.
    }

    delete[] array;

    return 0;
}
